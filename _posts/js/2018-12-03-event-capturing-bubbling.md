## 3 phases of event propagation:

- **Capturing phase** - the event goes down to the element
  -  addEventListener(..., true)
- **Target phase** - the event reached the target element
- **Bubbling phase** - the event bubbles up from the element
  -  addEventListener(..., false)

## event.target and event.currentTarget:

- **event.target** - the deepest element that originated the event
- **event.currentTarget (=this)** - the current element that handles the event (the one that has the handler on it)

## Stop bubbling:

- **event.stopPropagation** - stops the move upwards, but on the current element all other handlers will run
- **event.stopImmediatePropagation** - stops the bubbling and prevent handlers on the current element from running
